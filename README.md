# Rubik Cubie Java Processing
This project consisted of the development of a three-dimensional game program about the 3x3 Rubik's Cube, Java was used in the Processing IDE development environment. This project allows the user to interact with the famous puzzle virtually and learn the strategies necessary to solve it. A three-dimensional graphical representation of the Rubik's Cube has been implemented, which provided a visually appealing and realistic experience for the player.

The program not only offers an accurate simulation of the Rubik's Cube, but also includes interactive functionalities so that the player can manipulate the cube and make moves.
